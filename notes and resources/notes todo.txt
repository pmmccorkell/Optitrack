todo:
Create MQTT pub and sub classes
Subscription run independent of other toolboxes
	portable to OptiTrack, Qualisys, or general usage
	
Publisher run OptiTrack as a subclass (?), parse data into set topics and modes
	w/o a specified mode, could just run generically ?
	dev further for Qualisys


MQTT publish modes:


topic_prefix = "OptiTrack/RigidBody.Name"

/RigidBody			- everything
/PosQua				- FrameIndex, Position, Quaternion
/PosRot				- FrameIndex, Position, Rotation
/Mark				- FrameIndex, MarkerPosition, MarkerSize
/PosQuaMark			- FrameIndex, Position, Quaternion, MarkerPosition, MarkerSize
/PosRotMark			- FrameIndex, Position, Rotation, MarkerPosition, MarkerSize
/Dynamic			- As requested by the subscriber(s)

Unused ?
TimeStamp
FrameLatency
isTracked
HgTransform


Control topics ?
Frequency of control exchanges ? 1 Hz ?
topic_prefix = "OptiTrack/Control"

subscriber -> publisher:
Topic		What it does														Contents
/AddObject	Adds RigidBody.xyz object from the publisher's active topics		the EXACT name of a RigidBody object, ie "Position", "Quaternion", etc.
/RemObject	Removes RigidBody.xyz object from the publisher's active topics		the EXACT name of a RigidBody object, ie "Position", "Quaternion", etc.

publisher -> subscriber:
Topic		What it does														Contents
/Working	0 - LastFrame isn't changing, 1 - LastFrame is changing				Boolean or 0/1
	*maybe a better name?
/List		A list of the current Objects being broadcast						JSON of Object Names that are currently included in the "/Dynamic" topic
/Names		A list of RigidBody names available

Downside:
1 misbehaving client (or confused student) can screw it up for everyone
